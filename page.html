Welcome to Javascript Pacman, my tribute to the greatest arcade game of the '80s, written entirely in Javascript - no plug-ins required!! Please be patient while the all the images used in the game are downloaded now - this is to stop interruptions later. It will probably take a couple of minutes on a 56k modem.<br><br>
I've tested this on Internet Explorer 5.0 and Netscape 4.7. It has not been tested on Macs however, and will not yet work in Netscape 6. I wouldn't like to guess if it will run in any other browser at all..<p>So what's this all about then? Well.. it's a simple experiment in learning Object Orientated Programming that grew out of control. Now I am obsessed. You have been warned...<p>Note: Although this game is cross-browser, I discovered a strange cheat in IE that allows me to run it at twice the legal speed! (E-me if you really want the details..) If you want the full on experience and you've got a choice then go for IE here. Unfortunately I can't recreate this in Netscape, as it's effectively 'cheating the browser' to get it to run so fast, and the virtual policemen that patrol Netscape's javascript engine appear to be doing their job correctly - darn!<p><font color="yellow">NEW FEATURES!</font>

<ul>
<li>I've created a little artificial intelligence function for the ghosts, so they no longer roam around blind, so watch out!
<li>There's now five mazes to get through!
<li>If you really can't handle the speed of the IE version, I've added a game speed selector. After you've played a game, you'll be given the option to change the speed..
</ul>
<br>
The instructions and keys will appear below once the images have loaded. If you've really read all this it should be any time now!
